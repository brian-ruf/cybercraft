# REQUIREMENMTS

# Platforms

CyberCraft is designed and developed for Windows 10+ and macOS 13+. It may also work on recent Linux distros.

## Windows:

CyberCraft is currently developed and tested on Windows 11. 

Testing on Windows 10 is planned for Summer 2025.

## macOS:

Testing on macOS 13, 14, and 15 is planned for Summer 2025.

## Linux:

CyberCraft is likely to work on newer versions of Linux.
As time permits, this may be tested in the latter part of 2025. 

The command for granting execution permission to the macOS build and run bash scripts will vary by Linux OS. 

Once execution permission is grated, the macOS bash scripts should work for Linux.

# Python and PySide6

CyberCraft is developed and tested using Python 3.12.4 and PySide6 6.9.0. 

Testing on Python 3.13 is planned for Summer 2025.

The current version of PySide6 requires Python 3.7 or later.While CyberCraft may work with Python versions earlier than 3.12, no testing has been conducted, nor is testing of earlier Python versions planned.


# Internet Connection
An internet is required to:
- Clone the repository
- Acquire dependencies from [https://pypi.org/](https://pypi.org/) before compiling or running the native Python code
- Check for new OSCAL versions from [https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL)
- (**Future**) Acquire content from the OSCAL Content Repository ([https://registry.oscal.io](https://registry.oscal.io))

OSCAL support files from the NIST OSCAL GitHub repository are pre-loaded into CyberCraft. For this feature, an Internet connection is only necessary to check for new OSCAL versions or refresh/repair the support files for a current OSCAL version.

# CyberCraft Pre-Compiled Executables

There are no special requirements to download and install a pre-compiled version of CyberCraft on your Windows or macOS.
